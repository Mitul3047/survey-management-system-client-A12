I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address an unfortunate mistake that occurred recently. Regrettably, I inadvertently pushed the client-side code to the wrong repository and the server-side code to another.
I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused. I understand the importance of maintaining the integrity and organization of our repositories, and I take full responsibility for this oversight.
To rectify this issue, I have already begun the process of reverting the incorrect code and ensuring that the proper code is placed in the respective repositories.
Moving forward, I will be implementing additional checks and being more vigilant to prevent such errors in the future. I deeply value our team's collaboration and the integrity of our codebase, and I am committed to upholding these standards.
Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.
